Functional specification
========================

# Event-level methods

All of these methods adhere to the following pattern (in pseudocode to show types)

    float pt(const event)
        ... //Gets the value of pt
        return x
    end

The underlying event is accessed to calculate/retrieve the variable of interest.
The return types are specified using `pt -> rettype`. 

## `stpol.stable.file`

Contains methods that give information about an EDM-file. All methods take the filename string as a single argument.

* `total_processed => int`: the total count of events processed before any filtering.
* `sample_type => map(string => string)`: returns the sample type from the filename encoded in a map(dictionary) with the following keys:

~~~
isolation: "iso", "antiiso"
systematic: "nominal", "jes_up", "jer_down", ...
sample: "T_t_ToLeptons", "TTJets_FullLept", "SingleMu", ...
tag: "Oct3_123456..."
~~~

## `stpol.stable.tchan.muon`

### Generic for leptons

* `pt, eta, phi, mass, reliso -> float`
* `id -> int`: the gen-level particle id (Pythia scheme)
* `mtw -> float`: the transverse mass of the lepton+MET system
* `charge -> int`

### Specific for muons

* `globaltrack -> int`
* `innertrack -> int`

## `stpol.stable.tchan.electron`

### Generic for leptons

(as above)

### Specific for electrons

* `mvaid`

## `stpol.stable.tchan.vetolepton`

* `pt, eta, phi, mass, reliso -> float`
* `id -> int`: the gen-level particle id (Pythia scheme)
* `charge -> int`

## `stpol.stable.tchan.bjet`

The (b-tagged) jet associated with the decay t -> W b

* `pt, eta, phi, mass -> float`
* `id -> int`: the gen-level particle id (Pythia scheme). In general assigned via the PAT mechanisms for parton flavour.
* `dr -> float`: the Î”R with respect to the isolated lepton in the event
* `pu_mvaid -> float`: the pile-up MVA id
* `bd_csv -> float`: the CSV b-discriminator
* `bd_tchp -> float`: the TCHP b-discriminator

## `stpol.stable.tchan.specjet1`

The jet taken to be from the recoiling light quark. Used for the spin basis.
See `stpol.stable.tchan.bjet` for the interface.

## `stpol.stable.tchan.specjet2,3...`

Other spectator jets not associated with any leg in the t-channel diagram. Ordered by pt descending.
See `stpol.stable.tchan.bjet` for the interface.

## `stpol.stable.tchan.top`

The reconstructed top quark associated with the t-channel diagram.

* `pt, eta, phi, mass -> float`

## `stpol.stable.event`

Overall event-level parameters.

* `met`: the missing transverse energy
* `c`: centrality
* `njets`: the number of good jets passing the jet ID
* `ntags`: the number of good jets passing the jet ID ***and*** the default b-tagging working point used in the analysis.
* `ismu -> bool`: is the event a muon event (single (anti)isolated lepton is muon)?
* `isele -> bool`: is the event an electron event?
* `vetolepton.nmuons`, `vetolepton.nelectrons`: the count of additional non-signal veto muons/electrons.

## `stpol.stable.weights`
The weights interface is subject to change based on the most optimal implementation of the weights and systematics.

* `pileup.nominal`: the MC-to-data PU reweighting based on Ntrue.
* `generator.nominal`: the generator weight, relevant for e.g. the Sherpa samples
* `toppt.nominal`: the top-pt reweighting, only defined for ttbar samples

## `stpol.stable.event.costheta`

Angular variables associated with the Wtb vertex.

* `lj`: the angle between the charged lepton and the b-jet in the spectator jet basis
* `bl`: the angle in the eta-beamline basis

## `stpol.stable.event.costheta_gen`

As above, but with gen-level particles.

## Description of backends

These methods take an abstract Event as input and return the corresponding value for the Event. The Event type depends on the backend and can be for example ``fwlite::(Chain)Event``, a tuple of ``run``, ``lumi``, ``event`` id-s etc.
