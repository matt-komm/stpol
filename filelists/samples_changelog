git hash: 80f408e used for MVA adding, MVA trainig same as 39a2ddb (i.e. /hdfs/local/stpol/step3/Jul26_MVA_multivar_v1/)
Explanation: New step3 based on modified step2 (only nominal done). For changes in step2 see previous sample. MVA same as prior sample, no new training.

filelist: filelists/Aug4_0eb863_full/
Explanation: as Aug4_c6a4b11, but with all sustematics.i
There was a slight issue with data luminosity, but this was mostly solved by a crab resubmit. There is a very minor overlap between Aug1 and July15/Single*1 which is to be removed.

step: step2
git hash: 5a0165 processing, 0eb8c59 extra configuration
filelist: filelists/Aug1_5a0165/step2
Explanation:
    Added missing data.
    Reorganized the MET sequences in step2, making them call a common method.
    Incorporated the phi-modulation correction using standard modules.
    PU weight variations now calculated using variated data PU histograms.
    Using conservative scale factors on lepton weights by default.
    MET is missing from the output, bugfix 64fab0
-------
Sample: datasets/step2/data/Aug1
git hash: ?????
Explanation:
processed some 0.9/fb of data that was missing from the previous iteration of step1 (Jul15)
Note: due to incorrect lumi sections there is a very slight overlap between Aug1 and Jul15 which is not yet fixed (FIXME).

Sample: /hdfs/local/stpol/step3/Jul26_MVA_multivar_v1/
git hash: 39a2ddb
Explanation:
    Changed the MVA training fundamentally. Now we're using inclusive samples for training and exclusive samples for testing/plotting. In addition, this is the first MVA training where we do multiple MVAs in accordance to variable ranking allowing us to choose also partial variable list if we want to. What has also changed is the BDT variable naming in the trees:
    * Electrons, the best is: mva_BDT_with_top_mass_C_eta_lj_el_pt_mt_el_pt_bj_mass_bj_met_mass_lj
    * Muons, the best is: mva_BDT_with_top_mass_eta_lj_C_mu_pt_mt_mu_met_mass_bj_pt_bj_mass_lj
    If one wants one can remove part of the names ending to get an MVA with smaller list of vars. For example an MVA with only top three vars would be:
    * Electrons: mva_BDT_with_top_mass_C_eta_lj
    * Muons: mva_BDT_with_top_mass_eta_lj_C
